# PixiSlot
Animated Slot Machine using PixiJS v5. Project is calculating spin and win before the animation goes off.

## Requirements
I used PixiJS v5' filters. You won't see them without hardware accelaration.

## Where can I see it?
Live version is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://mateuszsuder.github.io/PixiSlot/)

## Purpose of project
I like challenges and also I'm really into slot games. I wanted to do my own and also learn something more about PixiJS.
